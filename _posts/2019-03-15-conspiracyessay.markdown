In our age of modern science, there remains an obscure medieval idea, and a rather absurd one at that: A 2018 poll shows that more than 24.8 million Americans think the world is flat. Though they have been disproven time and time again, dozens of grand conspiracy theories still exist. Three in ten people think that climate change is a hoax, even though 97% of climate scientists agree that is it happening. After 50 years with no evidence of a conspiracy, a Gallup poll shows that 61% of Americans still think there was a larger plot in the JFK assassination. Even some of the most absurd theories, such as the theory that “lizard people” control the world, are believed by at least 4% of the population. Conspiracy theories can be easily proved false, and have been by hundreds of researchers, but the theories are often non-falsifiable, meaning that no amount of evidence is enough to make it collapse.

First of all, grand conspiracy theories are easily disproved. The thousands of articles on the Internet and in books show that. For example, an article from Popular Mechanics says that “On[e] reason is the shadows, which are the result of parallel sun rays with no diffusion… In modern times, we could just change the color with CG, but back then, altering images with computers wasn't possible… Even if NASA had secretly invented computer graphics and kept it from the public, the organization would have … needed to coordinate the story with dozens of world leaders, including our enemy at the time, Russia.” This means that, in the case of the Moon landing and many other grand conspiracy theories, it is usually easier to do the actual thing (ex. land on the moon) than fake it. Also, a mathematical model made by researchers and published in the journal PLOS One shows how keeping a grand conspiracy under wraps is extremely difficult, with at least one conspirator spilling the beans over time. The paper says that “The model is also used to estimate the likelihood of claims from some commonly-held conspiratorial beliefs; these are namely that the moon-landings were faked, climate-change is a hoax, vaccination is dangerous and that a cure for cancer is being suppressed by vested interests. Simulations of these claims predict that intrinsic failure would be imminent even with the most generous estimates for the secret-keeping ability of active participants—the results of this model suggest that large conspiracies (≥1000 agents) quickly become untenable and prone to failure.” Therefore there is little chance a conspiracy theory could be covered up for very long. This proves that grand conspiracy theories should not be believed, even though many still do.

In addition to ignoring how improbable cover-ups would be, conspiracy theories are often without evidence (the theorists will often poke holes based on their ignorance of the true facts). They are often non-falsifiable, which means it is impossible to prove the theory wrong. A famous example is from the astronomer and cosmologist Carl Sagan: That an invisible, incorporeal (having no material existence) dragon lives in his garage. There is no way to know if there really is a dragon and is therefore non-falsifiable. As he puts it: “Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists? Your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true. Claims that cannot be tested, assertions immune to disproof are veridically worthless, whatever value they may have in inspiring us or in exciting our sense of wonder. What I'm asking you to do comes down to believing, in the absence of evidence, on my say-so.”  Karl Popper, known as one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century, said, “A scientific statement is one that could possibly be proven wrong.” A non-falsifiable statement is therefore unscientific and should not be believed. Another example of a non-falsifiable theory mimicking statements made by theorists is Russell’s Teapot, an analogy formulated by the philosopher and Nobel laureate Bertrand Russell, which states the belief that a china teapot orbiting the Sun between Earth and Mars cannot be disproved, but that does not mean it is true (and vice versa). Conspiracy theorists will often say “You can’t prove [insert theory here] wrong, so it must be right.” An example of a non-falsifiable conspiracy theory is that aliens landed in Roswell. This theory can never be disproved (‘You just didn’t look hard enough’), but that does not mean that the theory is actually true. In addition, the book A Skeptic’s Guide To The Universe shows how conspiracy theories do not collapse from solid evidence, as the theorist can say “it’s not enough” or state that the person pointing this out is obviously part of the conspiracy who is trying to cover up the loose holes. For example, ‘anti-vaxxers’ (people who believe that vaccines are unsafe and often think that they cause autism) will often require extremely costly and immoral experiments (that seem logical yet would never get approved) to be conducted in order to prove that vaccines are unsafe. Just because it is impossible to find evidence against the existence of Sagan’s incorporeal, invisible dragon does not actually mean it exists.

In conclusion, grand conspiracy theories are usually absurd, non-falsifiable and without evidence. Mathematical models prove that it is virtually impossible for these grand conspiracies to actually exist. Theorists accuse people of being involved in conspiracies if they point out an error in their reasoning. Though these theories can be easily disproven, millions still believe in them - and this can cause serious harm to both themselves and the environment. Epidemics of measles have been caused by so-called “anti-vaxxers” thinking that having their children vaccinated with the MMR will give them autism - even though science disproves it.
