They found me sitting in a flat-packed box sitting in the vast expanse of an IKEA warehouse, somehow loaded me into a small grey Honda Civic, and drove me to a small ninth-floor apartment in Pittsburgh. There, they opened my corrugated-cardboard box, gave the octagonal packaging to their one-year-old boy to use as a playpen and spent an hour bolting together my four pristine legs and my smooth birch tabletop, shimmering in the glare of the overhead fluorescent kitchen light.

That was twelve years ago.

Today, I still stand upright at the center of the light-tan dining room, wooden feet planted firmly on a fluffy brown-and-green carpet with some sort of ‘modern art design’ - meaning a bunch of squares and circles jammed together like a jigsaw. I am no longer as pristine; my joints creak loudly every time I am shifted and the edges concealing my metal folding mechanisms are slightly swollen from water seeping into the wood, but I still serve my purpose well.

Each day in the fall, when the children come home through the garage door, they drop their backpacks on the nearest chair they can find and sit down at me to complete their homework over a bowl of dates and apples. As they snack on the fruit, I mull over the mathematics worksheets (paper is translucent enough for me to see through) and solve the problems mentally. If only I could talk in the human language, they would be done with math homework in about two minutes. It is incredibly agonizing to watch them repeatedly furrowing their brows and looking over their equations when it is obvious that they multiplied wrong on the second step - again. I have a feeling that this agony is cruel and unusual punishment and therefore is unconstitutional.

It is also incredibly agonizing to not have the ability to consume food. Ironic, isn’t it, that an object created for the express purpose of dining cannot dine? My nonexistent taste buds water every time the mother places a bowl of steaming ramen atop me. I have often been asked why I am faithful to them even though they cause me much misery. It is because of two reasons. First, though they have many flaws, they are still a fascinating bunch; and second, I hope that if I am faithful in this life, I won’t be a table the next time around.

The dinners are always interesting, with conversations over things ranging from the saltiness of the night’s broccoli to socioeconomic discrimination against the upper-middle class (the mother studied sociology) to whether or not Father should get a new job. During particularly passionate arguments, there is pounding on the table - that is, me. Usually, the fist hammers the wood when someone is trying to drive a point across, but why would they bring their hand down on me, an innocent bystander, causing me to shout in pain? That is one thing about humans that I don’t get. Another is their obsession with some sort of magic screen connected to a bunch of buttons that they call a computer. From my vantage point below, I have no idea of what they do on that thing, pressing the same buttons over and over and over again.

I once asked the computer what it was used for, but the egotistical thing just talked about how great it was and rambled on about something called the Internet, some programming thing called Python, and pictures of cats. The younger one thinks cats are cute, but the elder child has apparently heard many stories of his classmates getting attacked by them. I have never seen one, but the word currently has an extremely negative connotation. The family had an extremely eventful argument over cats once. I cannot remember the exact debate, but I do remember a high-velocity fist hitting me.

That caused one of my legs to splinter down the side, which split wider when they moved a year later. During the drive in the moving truck, it made a sudden right to evade a particularly large pothole, causing my splintered leg to collide with the hard wall of the shipping container.

They fixed it as best they could with a tube of superglue, but with each hammer of an angry fist, each careless person running into me, the crack widens, a void of jagged black in the soft rolling grains of wood. One day, it will break - but until then, I still stand faithfully, a stoic birch table in the middle of a chaotic world.
