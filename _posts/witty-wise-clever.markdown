The sun scattered rays of burning light into the airport as Witty, Wise and Clever watched the plane take off from LaGuardia, carrying their parents to “somewhere away from this noisy and New York City”. Saying that “Wise is old enough to look over you” (even though he was only five minutes older than the rest), they had left them to care for themselves.

“What should we do this summer?” asked Clever.
“You’re the clever one. You’ll think of something,” responded Witty, tired from jumping up and down in anticipation of the last bell.
“Fine,” Clever said, turning to Wise. “You’re the wise one. What should we do this summer?”
“Nothing. Then nothing bad will happen to us.”

They agreed that it was a good plan. 
And it was, until the fluttering of a bird’s wings was heard inside the City Hall.

Let me tell you about this bird. It was a pigeon, to be exact, a perfectly normal pigeon, albeit a hungry one. It had an ordinary beak, ordinary feathers, ordinary eyes. But this pigeon happened to fly in through an open door into the city hall of New York City. The pigeon soon realized that it was trapped, and it flew around frantically, trying to find a way out. It wound in and out of hallways and narrow corridors, until a little blue tablet caught its eye. To the pigeon, it looked like food. And the pigeon hadn’t eaten in days. So the pigeon swallowed it, along with the ancient spirit, that when removed from its rightful place, would cause destruction to all.

Of course, the pigeon knew none of this. Having found an open window, the bird hopped into the air, oblivious to the impending doom that it was responsible for.
… 
Witty, Wise and Clever were interrupted in the middle of one of their do-nothing sessions, (which, Wise pointed out, was actually doing something), by a loud bang. 
The grass was turning into a sheet made of the word grass and all of the houses and skyscrapers turned into rooftops and floors and walls and windows, with everything inside crumbling too.

“What can we do?” cried Clever.
“Positively nothing!” responded Wise.
“There has to be something!”
“That something is nothing!”
“Hey, stop that argument! There’s an elephant in the room - New York is falling apart!”
“We’re going to need to work together if we’re ever going to get anything done,” continued Witty.

The arguing ceased. Not really because of the speech by Witty, but because of the words from the ground that were slowly trickling upwards to create a majestic elephant looming over them, the letters e, l, p, h, a and t smoothing into a solid gray surface as the elephant stood up, waving its trunk in the air.

“What … just … happened?”
“I said that there was an elephant in the room.”
“And?”
“An elephant appeared!”
“So?”
“So a rock hit Wise’s head,” said Witty sincerely.

Moments later, a rock came tumbling down out of the sky. Wise looked up just in time to see it hit his face.

“NOW do you get it?”
“Yeah. But don’t ever do that again!”

Lost in the realization of what was happening, the trio didn’t realize that the elephant was still there until it nearly trampled them.

“Ahhh!” they cried in unison, taking off as fast as there legs would carry them, not stopping to breathe nor looking where they were running.
	
Meanwhile, Sassy and Nerdy, also trying to find their way out of the apparent mess that was New York City, stood on a pile of word-rubble, Nerdy casually flipping through an extremely thick handbook. 

“On page 5,095 it says that ‘All persons are to be happy at all times, even in times of disaster (car crash, tornado, alien invasion etc.)’”

“Oh, I’m TOTALLY happy right now.”
“On page 5,096 it says that ‘Bikes can be found in many locations on the streets and that if one is found, it is reasonable to assume that the owner left it there for charity and it is okay to take it.’”
“There aren’t any bikes left to steal.”
“On page 5,097 it says that ‘Should a certain blue tablet ever be removed from the city hall …’”

That’s when Witty, Wise and Clever, still running from the elephant, collided with them.

“Sorry!” cried Clever, continuing to run. 
“Hey! Get back here! What do you think you’re doing?”
“Escaping the elephant!”
“What elephant?”
“This one!”

Sassy’s sassiness quickly gave way to fear as they all started to run - except for Nerdy, weighed down by his multi-thousand page book. 

“Drop it!” Nerdy escaped just in time to see the handbook get trampled by the elephant.
“Oh, well.”
“But your handbook’s ruined!”
“Oh, well that’s okay. I have it all memorized. Like that part about the tablet-”
“Whatcha talkin’ ‘bout?”
“That tablet that’s supposed to destroy the city!”
“What?! How come you didn’t tell me ‘bout that?”
“I was going to, but then those…”
“But but but. Always your excuse.”

“Anyway,” continued Sassy, “If only you had told me about that EARLIER, we could’ve found that stupid bird! It flew out the window in my office at that City Hall with the tablet in its beak!”

“Why didn’t you tell us EARLIER?”
“It didn’t seem that important…” started Sassy.
“There’s no time to argue! There’s an ele- oh man. Good thing I caught myself. Well, there’s no time to lose! We have to catch this bird!”

“How? That’s TOTALLY as easy as falling off a log,” said Sassy, falling off a log.
“Watch your language. That sort of thing has been happening lately. Putting that aside, there’s five of us, five boroughs in the city. Each of us can take one section. We’ll meet at that Alice in Wonderland thing at Central Park, or at least where it used to be.”

“That’s going to take forever to search such a large area!” Witty cried, but Clever was already running.
“Oh, well what choice do we have?” responded Nerdy. 
So they took off in separate directions.
By the end of the day, they had found many pigeons but not one with a blue tablet.
“Well, at least we pigeons to eat,” said Nerdy, examining what they had caught. “Think on the bright side! On page 2,704 of the handbook it said that ‘All persons are permitted to enjoy themselves even when they are in the worst situation possible.’”

“Well, think about the negative side! What if the elephant comes back?”
There was a trampling noise. “I told you to watch your language, Sassy! The elephant’s back!”
Witty turned. If we used an idiom to make the elephant appear, we can use an idiom to make the elephant disappear, he thought. 

“When the cat’s away the mice will play.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Watch.”

The remains of Alice in Wonderland formed a group of playful mice, playing around with a ball of string left by the cat. The elephant’s eyes darted nervously from side to side for a few moments before it ran away, trunk waving as it trampled what was left of the trees.
“So it worked.”
“Hmm,” thought Witty, turning suddenly. “Look! I found the bird with the tablet!”
They all looked toward him - and indeed, in his palm was the bird with the tablet in its stomach, still oblivious to what it had done.

“How did you do that?”
“Remember the elephant? And the log? And the mice?”
“But how are we going to get this to the city hall? We’re standing on an ocean of words!”
“My iPhone still works,” suggested Sassy. “And it still has a Wifi connection!”
“We could use that to find our way to it, but the ocean is twelve feet deep! And all three of us can’t swim!”

“My turn,” said Wise. Thrusting out his hand as if it were a wand, he muttered, “Remember, we’re all in the same boat.”

All five were thrown into a small wooden boat, Clever landing on top of Wise. 
“Oww! Why did you have to throw me headfirst?” complained Clever. 
“No time for complaints! Let’s go!”

Frantically rowing, Witty, Wise, Clever, Sassy and Nerdy reached the building just in time. Witty dropped the tablet from his hand and let it sink… 
And the world faded to black.
… 
“I guess we did do something this summer, didn’t we?”
“Well, I think I’ve learned something. We should really enjoy the world while it lasts and not in some explosion of words.”

“The bird’s gone, the tablet’s back in the City Hall, that’s not going to happen again. It is going to be a nice summer after all.”

And it was, until far off in the distance, the fluttering of wings disturbed a slight breeze blowing into an open door in the City Hall.
