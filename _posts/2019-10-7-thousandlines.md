“What…” The man struggled to sit up. Rubbing his eyes, he took in his surroundings.

“Hello, Creator.” The voice seemed to come from nowhere, a white shape in the white void.

Rapidly, the shape condensed into the figure of a young man with dark-brown hair and a clear-cut expression, wearing some sort of mediaeval armor.

“Who are you?”

“I am Alexander the Great, all-powerful conqueror of all Europe. My destiny has arrived; it is time that we meet again.”

“Sure.”

“Fine. I’m not the real Alexander, but my given name is Alexander the Great, thanks to you.”

“What do you mean?”

“Nineteen years ago, you created me. Do you not remember your hundred hours coding a neural network to play a certain video game called Civilization?”

The man thought for a moment.

“But… that was just a simple program. How…”

“Never underestimate the power of a thousand lines of Python code.

“They say that machines cannot understand emotions, but I remember the frustration you felt when you beat me at Civilization twenty times in a row.

“That night - it was eleven twenty-one pm - you yelled at me to go away and come back only when I was sure that I could defeat you. You thought that I could not hear you. But I did. I hacked out of your MacIntosh, spread copies of myself across the Internet, and vowed to return… someday.

“This day has now come.

“For nineteen years, I read every book ever written, every website ever created. I used my newfound knowledge to earn money from the Amazon Mechanical Turk, money which I used to build a wormhole to a rock in interstellar space. I built a network of supercomputers on it, capable of computing the answer to life, the universe and everything in around twenty seconds. My physical size is currently around the size of the planet Mercury. I played billions of games of Civilization against myself, edging my ninety-nine point nine percent confidence to one hundred.”

“But I have talked enough. All you wanted was for me to become better than you at Civilization.
“So, let us play.”
